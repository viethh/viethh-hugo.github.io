abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are gradually replacing humans in many decision making processes, such as pricing in high-frequency markets. Recent studies on algorithmic pricing have shown that algorithms can learn sophisticated grim-trigger strategies with the intent of keeping supracompetitive prices. This paper focuses on algorithmic collusion detection. One frequent suggestion is to look at the inputs of the strategies, for example on whether the algorithm conditions its own price on past competitors' prices. In this paper, I show that this approach might not be sufficient since the algorithms can learn reward-punishment schemes that are fully independent from the rival's actions. The mechanism that ensures stability of supra-competitive prices is self-punishment. I explore a novel test that builds on the intuition that a crucial ingredient for algorithmic collusion is synchronous learning. When one algorithm is unilaterally retrained, it learns more competitive strategies that exploit collusive behavior. Since this change in strategies happens only when algorithms are colluding, retraining can be used as an instrument to detect algorithmic collusion. Lastly, I show how one could get the same insights on collusive behavior using only historical data from a single algorithm.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: I show that algorithms can learn reward-punishment schemes that are fully independent from the rivalâ€™s actions and I propose a model-free test for algorithmic collusion based on historical data.
