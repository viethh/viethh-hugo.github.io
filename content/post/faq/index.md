In this page I will collect anquestions that I frequently asked myself during my PhD, possibly with answers.

Personally, the article for PhD students that helped me the most is [“Doing research”](https://medium.com/@paul.niehaus/doing-research-18cb310529e0) by Paul Niehaus. But beware, it might not work for everyone.
